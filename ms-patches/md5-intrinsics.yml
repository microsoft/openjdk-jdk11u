title: jdk11u Backport of Implement MD5 Intrinsics on x86

- details:
  - The existing implementation of sun.security.provider.MD5.implCompress is done in Java.
  - When compiled to native code, the generated code contains many Java-isms like array-bound checks.
  - That hurts performance for an algorithm that can be used to validate large amounts of data.
  - To speed it up, we can simply create an intrinsic that implements the algorithm without the Java-isms.
  - That is a similar approach to intrinsics for SHA1/SHA256/SHA512.
