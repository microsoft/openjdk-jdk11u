  - Fixes the Windows AArch64 jdk11u build error 'No rule to make target .../windows/conf/tzmappings'.
  - The root cause of this error is that the GENSRC_TARGETS are not built.
  - This fix removes checks for CREATING_BUILDJDK to ensure that the GENSRC_TARGETS are built unconditionally.
  - These checks were also found to be incorrect in https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8217739
- release_note:
