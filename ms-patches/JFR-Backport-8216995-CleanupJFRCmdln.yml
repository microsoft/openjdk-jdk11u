  - Cleanup JFR commandLine processing - JfrRecorder::is_disabled is called early during bootstrap and uses JVMFlag::find_flag directly to check whether the -XX:-FlightRecorder has been set on the command line. 
  - Using the FLAG_IS_CMDLINE macro from global_extensions have the same effect cleans it up and might avoid a linear scan.
  - This is a backport of the original commit "https://hg.openjdk.org/jdk/jdk/rev/65a1d49d1718" to JDK 11.
  - Differences with original commit - In the enable () method - Line 63, There is an additional validation check for the flight recorder value. 
    If the FlightRecorder value is already set to true, then the FLAG_SET_MGMT(bool, FlightRecorder, true); is skipped.   
- release_note: Clean up JFR Command Line.
