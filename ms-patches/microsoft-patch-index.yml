# Microsoft patches applied to the Microsoft Build of OpenJDK
#
# This index file is ouur explicit record of patches we are maintaining for our build of
# the OpenJDK until they are (a) merged upstream, (b) abandoned, or (c) no longer
# required by Microsoft's internal processes (we use Azure DevOps for our builds and
# test, for instance).
#
# For each patch branch, there  will be a file in the ms-patches/ folder that has the
# name of the branch in it's file name (for example, this file follows that pattern).
# The file is the source data for the README file we generate in the release branch, and
# contains such information as Microsoft dev responsible for the patch, the original
# author(s), associated JEP- or JBS- issue, and a summary of the patches' purpose.
